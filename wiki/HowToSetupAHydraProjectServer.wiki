= How to Setup a Hydra Project Server =

Grab the trunk:
{{{
 svn checkout http://hydraproject.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ current
}}}

Will check the code out into 'current' (cd into it), then...
{{{
 cd config
}}}

== Database Config ==

{{{  
  cp database.yml.example database.yml
  vi database.yml
}}}

Edit the 'production' entry.

If you're creating a datbase by hand in MySQL console:

{{{
CREATE DATABASE hydra;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hydra.* TO 'hydra_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '2manyseekrets';
# If you need to be able to connect from other (all) hosts)
#GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hydra.* TO 'hydra_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '2manyseekrets';
}}}

_Captain obvious sez, please change the password/etc to one of your own choosing._

The database.yml for the above would look like:
{{{
production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: hydra
  username: hydra_user
  password: 2manyseekrets
  # Uncomment & tweak this line if you're having DB connection issues:
  #socket: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock 
}}}

== Site Config ==

  Edit the config file.  Some of the domain name entries seem redundant; this is in case you want to run the site on a port other than 80 (i.e. foo.org:6969)

{{{
 cp config.yml.example config.yml
 vi config.yml
}}}

== Federated Sites Config ==

These are the list of trusted sites that are in your network, or "federation".  _(gotta love the Star Trek reference)_

{{{
 cp federation.yml.example federation.yml
 vi federation.yml
}}}

Edit the credentials, note: you do not need to specify (self), i.e. the server you are configuring.  You only specify trusted peer sites.

== Get Mongrel ==

Install the gem via:

{{{
 gem install mongrel
}}}

== Mongrel Cluster Config ==

Create a new mongrel cluster config file in your favorite text editor:

{{{
vi mongrel_cluster.yml
}}}

Example contents of your mongrel_cluster.yml file:

{{{
---
cwd: /u/apps/torrentdope/current
port: "3000"
environment: production
address: 127.0.0.1
pid_file: log/mongrel.pid
servers: 2
}}}

The more popular your site will be, the more mongrels you will need.  (Note: 6-8 should be plenty for a site with anywhere from 5,000 - 15,000 visitors per day)

== Run the Migrations ==

Change directories back to your rails root and run the migrations:

{{{
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
}}}

== Start the Mongrels ==

Still in rails root, run:
{{{
mongrel_rails cluster::start
}}}

You should now have 2 instances running, one at localhost:3000, the other at localhost:3001.  Use apache, nginx, etc. to proxy from port 80 to these mongrels.

[http://blog.codahale.com/2006/06/19/time-for-a-grown-up-server-rails-mongrel-apache-capistrano-and-you/ Time for a Grownup Server] has a good guide on getting Apache playing nice with mongrel.

I actually prefer nginx (it's a lightweight web server, like apache, but only uses about 6mb of memory and is blazing fast), but it's less well-known so support may be harder to come by if you hit a snag.
