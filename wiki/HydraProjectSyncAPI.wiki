#summary Outlines the intra-server Sync API that hydraproject servers use to communicate with one another.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

The hydraproject Sync API is RESTful, pull-driven and XML friendly.

Each server is solely responsible for keeping its data up to date by making requests to the fellow servers in its "federation".

= Example-based =

The following will assume that we are an admin of a hydraproject server that will be running on the domain name 'mongoose.com'.  Any valid domain names on the Internet can of course run THP servers.

= Rails-specific Federation YML =

Implementors are free to implement the 'federation list' however they see fit.  In the spec rails app, see: config/federation.yml.example.  This is a YAML-encoded file that is simply a list of trusted sites, each with a few required fields and an optinoal ip_required field.

{{{
--- 
- domain: foo.org
  passkey: wafflesandjam69
  api_url: http://foo.org/api
- domain: bar.net
  passkey: pigsinablanket42
  api_url: https://www.bar.net/hydra/api.php
  ip_required: 66.29.132.45
}}}

Required fields:
  * domain - domain name of the server
  * passkey - secret password key used for authentication
  * api_url - fully qualified URL of the remote API endpoint (note: secure connections "https" are allowed and encouraged if possible)

Optional field(s):
  * ip_required - The IP Address of the remote client.  If a different IP than the one listed attempts to make a request, it should be denied.

In the above example
